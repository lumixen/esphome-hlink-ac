## Overview

This component is designed to control compatible Hitachi air conditioners using serial H-Link protocol. It serves as a replacement for proprietary cloud-based [SPX-WFGXX cloud adapters](https://www.hitachiaircon.com/ranges/iot-apps-controllers/ac-wifi-adapter-aircloud-home), enabling native Home Assistant climate integration through ESPHome. Tested with Hitachi RAK-25PEC AC.

## H-link protocol

H-link is a serial protocol designed to enable communication between climate units and external adapters, such as a central station managing multiple climate devices in commercial buildings or SPX-WFGXX cloud adapters. It allows to read the status of a climate unit and send commands to control it.

The protocol supports two types of communication frames:
1. Status inquiry from adapter, initiated with the `MT` prefix:
```
>> MT P=XXXX C=YYYY
<< OK P=XXXX C=YYYY
```
where `MT P=XXXX` is 16-bit numerical command and `C=YYYY` is a 16-bit XOR checksum. AC unit returns `OK P=XXXX`, where `XXXX` is the dynamic-length value of the requested "feature" (e.g. power state, climate mode, swing mode etc). 

2. Status change request, initiated with the `ST` prefix:
```
>> ST P=XXXX,XX(XX) C=YYYY
<< OK
``` 
where `P=XXXX,XX(XX)` specifies the function to modify and the new value, `C=YYYY` - 16-bit XOR checksum. The response `OK` confirms successful execution.

## Hardware

For PoC project I used the Lolin D32 ESP32 dev board. 

H-Link operates at 5V logic levels and provides a 12V power lane. Therefore, we need to step down the 12V power lane to 5V for the ESP dev board 5V input and use a 3.3V-to-5V logic level shifter for the Tx/Rx communication lines:

An example of wiring diagram with cheapo aliexpress building blocks that worked for me:

H-link connector is a 6-pin JST PA with 2.0 mm pitch.

If you're struggling to find a female connector in your local shop (like I did), you can find a similar 6-pin connector with 2.0mm pitch and do some shaping with a needle file. I managed to adapt a HY2.0 plug:

My AC unit had more than enough space to fit the dev board inside.

## ESPHome configuration

```yml
esphome:
  name: "hitachi-ac"

esp32:
  board: XXXX
  framework:
    type: esp-idf

uart:
  id: hitachi_bus
  tx_pin: GPIOXX
  rx_pin: GPIOXX
  baud_rate: 9600
  parity: ODD

external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/lumixen/esphome-hlink-ac.git
      ref: 2025.4.4
    components: [hlink_ac]

climate:
  - platform: hlink_ac
    name: "SNXXXXXX"

switch:
  - platform: hlink_ac
    remote_lock:
      name: Remote lock
    beeper:
      name: Beeper

  - platform: hlink_ac
    outdoor_temperature:
      name: Outdoor temperature

text_sensor:
  - platform: hlink_ac
    model_name:
      name: Model
```

without additional configuration the `hlink_ac` climate device provides all features supported by h-link protocol. If your device does not support some of the climate traits - you could adjust the esphome configuration explicitly:

```yml
climate:
  - platform: hlink_ac
    name: "SNXXXXXX"
    supported_modes:
      - "OFF"
      - COOL
    supported_swing_modes:
      - "OFF"
    supported_fan_modes:
      - AUTO
      - LOW
      - HIGH
    visual:
      min_temperature: 16.0
      max_temperature: 28.0
```

## H-link protocol reverse engineering

H-link specifications aren't publicly available, and this component was built using reverse-engineered data. It most likely doesn't cover all possible scenarios and combinations of features that different Hitachi climate devices offer. 

If you're willing to dive into the protocol communication on your own, this component offers a convenient way to monitor H-link addresses dynamically using text sensors. You can add any number of `debug` text sensors that will be polled at the same interval as other known addresses:

```yaml
text_sensor:
  - platform: hlink_ac
    debug:
      name: P0005
      address: 0x0005
  - platform: hlink_ac
    debug:
      name: P0201
      address: 0x0201
```

Each sensor sends an `MT P=address C=XXXX` request. If unit returns an `OK` response with a payload, it will be rendered as a text sensor value. For example, the address `0201` most likely returns [error codes](https://github.com/lumixen/esphome-hlink-ac/blob/main/docs/hlink_alarm_codes.csv) if something is wrong with the AC, but I haven't seen reliable proof yet (fortunately) to add it as an established sensor. Debug sensors can help monitor unknown addresses and their behavior throughout the Hitachi unit lifecycle.

H-link UART serial communication could be minotored using this snippet:

```yaml
uart:
  id: hitachi_bus
  tx_pin: GPIOXX
  rx_pin: GPIOXX
  baud_rate: 9600
  parity: ODD
  debug:
    direction: BOTH
    dummy_receiver: false
    after:
      delimiter: "\n"
    sequence:
      - lambda: UARTDebug::log_string(direction, bytes);
```
